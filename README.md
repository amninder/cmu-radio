<h3>Problem Statement: </h3>
The idea behind this project was to display radio stations on Google Maps. After Google Maps is loaded, the application searching the JSON stream for stations with their shout cast stream urls corresponding to latitude/longitude values, Google markers are displayed that allows the user to click the appropriate marker which provides an audio player interface for online audio streaming. I may have many ideas for future implementation

<h3>Highlights:</h3>
1. It is a new concept intended to playing internet radio stations from across the globe.
2. The interface is designed to make it easier to find radio stations by uni- versities.


iOS app I created to play radio stations around the us using REST API developed in django.
download the REST api from https://github.com/amninder/radio-api and change url of line 59 of ViewController.m to your own server url.
